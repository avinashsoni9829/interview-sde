/* Concept of static Variables */

    1) they are initiialized with value = 0

/*
  static member variable : 
  
  
  1) declared inside body of the class
  
  2) also know as class member variable 
  
  3) they must be defined outside the class
  
  4) static member variable does'nt belong to any object , but to whole class
  
  5) there will be only one copy of static member variable to the whole class
  
  6) any object can use the same copy of class variable 
  
  7) they can also be used with class name

/*

    static member function : 
    
    
    1)  they are qualified with the keyword static 
    
    2)  they are also called as class member functions 
    
    3)  they can be invoked without any object  
    
    4) they cann only access static member of the class
