Using the rest parameter syntax, we can create functions that can take
a variable number of arguments.

function extractingArgs(...args){
  return args[1];
}
- Rest parameter should 
always be used at the last 
parameter of a function:

- Although the syntax of spread operator is exactly the 
  same as the rest parameter, spread operator is used 
  to spread an array, and object literals.
  We also use spread operators where one or 
  more arguments are expected in a function call.
