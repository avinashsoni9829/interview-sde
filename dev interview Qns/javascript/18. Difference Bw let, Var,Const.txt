- The variables declared with the let keyword in the global scope behave 
just like the variable declared with the var keyword in the global scope.

- Variables that are declared with the var keyword in the global scope
  are added to the window/global object. 
  Therefore, they can be accessed using window.variableName.
- Whereas, the variables declared with the let keyword are not added to the global object,
  therefore, trying to access such variables using window.variableName results in an error
