- Promises are used to handle 
asynchronous operations in javascript.

-Before promises, callbacks were 
 used to handle asynchronous 
 operations. But due to limited 
 functionality of callback, 
 using multiple callbacks to 
 handle asynchronous 
 code can lead to unmanageable code.

- A promise is created using the 
Promise constructor which takes
 in a callback function with two 
parameters, resolve and reject 
respectively.

- We can consume any promise by 
  attaching then() and catch() methods 
  to the consumer.
