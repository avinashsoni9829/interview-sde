dom manipulation is slow 
entire dom is updated for small change

to solve this virtual dom is used 
main diff b/w real dom and virtual dom
object is any changes in virtual dom
will not reflect on the screen
directly 

react use two virtual dom to render ui
1) to store the current state 
2) to store the previous state
