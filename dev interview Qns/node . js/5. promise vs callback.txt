Call back() : a function passed as an argument to another function  
used to complete some task 


promise: 

promise -> object -> event completion / failure of async operation and its resulting value

basically in a promise we attach callbacks , instead of passing callbacks to a function


three state 
1.  pending 
2.  fulfilled
3.  rejected 


difference : 

callback get passed to a function 
promise attaches callback 
callback may or may not be asynchronous
promise is asynchronous 

advantage for using promise : 

1. control flow of async logic 
2. low coupling
3. error handling 
4. improved readablity and code - quality
